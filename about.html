    <p>I am a recent graduate of the Environmental & Resource Science program at Trent University. I have worked 
      on two land cover classification projects with Lower Trent Conservation and Cataraqui Region Conservation 
      Authority as a student. I have also done volunteer work at Trent University with environmental modeling and 
      spatial interpolation in the soil science field. My main areas of interest are conservation, precision 
      agriculture and more generally how GIS can be applied in these fields to solve environmental problems. I am 
      looking forward to furthering developing my skills within these fields through this collaborative project 
      with the CRCA.</p>

    <p>I previously studied Wildlife/Conservation Biology at U of Guelph. I recently worked with Peterborough 
      District MNRF on invasive water soldier mapping in the Trent Severn and fish sampling and agricultural 
      drainage classification in southern Ontario for DFO as a student. My main interests lie in applying GIS 
      in a conservation and natural resource management setting. Remote sensing courses at Fleming have really 
      piqued my interest in large scale landscape classification and machine learning applications. </p>

    <p>My background is in environmental geoscience and archaeology at the University of Western Ontario, 
      which allowed me to explore a variety of disciplines, including hydrology and paleoenvironmental analysis.
      I am now learning GIS web development techniques at Fleming College. I have previously worked on hazard 
      mapping research at UWO, and environmental planning projects as an intern with Hydro One. One of my primary 
      research interests is the use of remote sensing and GIS technologies for natural carbon sequestration and 
      landscape restoration. I am looking forward to using my experience and skills to develop watershed land 
      cover classification workflows with the CVCA.</p>
