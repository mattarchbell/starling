  <h1>Our approach to finding a solution</h1>

  <h2>Week 9</h2>
  <h3>Project idea development</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>We had the idea to develop a simple solution for Crowe Valley Conservation Authority to allow landowners to find wetland information 
    about their property using parcel data and wetland data and determining if those layers overlapped</li>
    <li>Although a simple idea, we struggled with how to implement this. Originally, we wanted to utilize open source solutions, namely Leaflet,
      as this would allow the solution to be adopted by anyone</li>
    <li>Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that Leaflet would take a lot of effort to learn, not to mention implement, and we were better off
      using some form of ESRI web application, as the CVCA had access to ArcGIS Online</li>
    <li>Our original problem statement had a massive scope; we intended to allow the user to filter layers, search for data, and we intended to 
      include a ton of layers. Shawn said "no"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 10</h2>
  <h3>Project idea development... Round 2</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>Our main idea remained the same, but with a drastically reduced scope. Our new plan of attack was to use ArcGIS Experience Builder to
      allow land owners to pick a parcel and have a pop-up display to show which layers intersected their land.
    </li>
    <li>With approval now garnered from Shawn, we began to explore the functionality of Experience Builder. First we needed data... and a way to 
      display it</li>
    <li>Our contact at CVCA was gracious enough to send over the parcel, wetlands, waterbodies, watercourses and CA boundary data, which we 
      uploaded to a webmap</li>
    <li>We struggled more than we probably should have to make sure we all were able to access both the webmap and experience builder application... 
      The group sharing settings are weird, okay?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 11</h2>
  <h3>Let's get the party started</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>The first order of business - Lets make this thing look nice! We palyed around with the widgets in experience builder to make it as aesthetic 
      as possible - including the CA logo and a cool side panel to display map info</li>
    <li>Although I kid, this design process was integral. Making sure the layout was functional was imperative to the user "experience"... We 
      wanted to be sure that anybody accessing this solution would be able to easily navigate through the map
    </li>
    <li></li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Week 12</h2>
  <h3>Creating the ultimate "Experience"</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>Now with the layout and base functionality of the program done, we had to make it do what we said it would do - 
      allow the user to see if parcels intersected the water features or not...</li>
    <li>Within the Web Map, we had to configure the pop-ups using Arcade. This language was new to all of us, but we 
      started to figure it out...</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 13</h2>
  <h3>It works...</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>With the appliction now working there were still a few issues. It looked fantastic in some instances, 
      but there was text overlapping areas it shouldnt have, images clipping the bounds of the side bar... </li>
    <li>Oh yeah, this thing is kinda due next week... We should probably start making a website for it! Lets 
      just grab a little css from here, a bit of html from there...</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 14</h2>
  <h3>Crunch time</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>With the Experience functioning properly, we just had to add some finishing touches and really put 
      some time into completing the website to accompany the submission</li>
    <li>We were able to integrate the application pretty seamlessly using an Iframe 
      (please don't be mad, Shawn). Tested on mobile, desktop and Matt's mom's iPad.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Options we looked at</h2>
  <p>We originally intended to develop this application from scratch... Using open source- leaflet.
    we considered geocortex... Settled onto creating a web app using arcgis online resources, but which application would we use - Experience builder 
  </p>
  <h2>What worked</h2>
  <p>building widgets to costomize the design of our ArcGIS "experience" - worked mostly out of the gate - 
    struggled with clipping of images and title/text, extraneous info from map. 
    Most of the costomization had to be completed in webmaps -  arcade expressions to perform the functionality we wanted, making layers non-interactable, etc.</p>

  <h2>Arcade to the rescue</h2>
  <p>The main functionality of the program (querying the parcel data) comes from a simple arcade expression that checks to see if the layers we have (wetlands, 
    watercourses, waterbodies, etc. intersect/ are within the boundary of the parcel</p>
