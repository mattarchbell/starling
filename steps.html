  <h1>Our approach to finding a solution</h1>

  <h2>Week 9</h2>
  <h3>PHASE 1: Problem Statement and Concept Development</h3>
	<p> <b>Action:</b> The first step for this project was to define our problem statement, define the ideal scenario if we were able to generate a web solution that solve this problem and investigate the consequences of not having this solution. At the same time we were thinking about what software solutions could be used to tackle and host this web solution.</p> 
	<p> <b>Outcomes:</b> Initially, the scope of our project was too large. Throughout out development progress we were focused too much on the type of software we would like to use rather then what makes the most sense as a solution to our problem. Below is our initial problem statement submitted to Shawn followed by the problem statement that was approved.</p> 
	<p style="font-style: italic;"> <b>Initial Problem Statement:</b> Create a web map application visualizing data for the conservation authority. Users should be able to filter layers, interact with features using popup displays, and to search for location information. Map will use a combination of data from the conservation authority (e.g. shapefiles obtained directly, information digitized from map images/pdfs) and open-source data (e.g. landcovers, typical monthly precipitation and temperature).</p> 
	<p style="font-style: italic;"> <b>Final problem statement:</b> Landowners can access website to find their property and if it falls into Conservation Authority regulation based on which features exist on their property.</p> 
  
  <p> <b>Development Progress:</b> </p>
  <ul class="bullet">
    
    <li>Our idea was to develop a simple solution for Crowe Valley Conservation Authority that would allow landowners to find wetland information 
    about their property using parcel data and wetland data and determining if those layers overlapped, and assist the conservation authority in 
    rapidly screening development proposals.</li>
    <li>Although a simple idea, we struggled with how to implement this. Originally, we wanted to utilize open source solutions, namely Leaflet,
      as this would allow the solution to be adopted affordably.</li>
    <li>Geocortex was also explored as a solution. Although a more expensive solution, the program has been used by Ontario counties as a means of
      effectively disseminating information to residents. Our initial idea was to allow users to export a PDF report for their parcel. We experimented
      with importing our environmental feature information during a lab session:</li>

	  <div class="caption">The map in the Geocortex HTML viewer.</div>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that Leaflet would take a lot of effort to learn, not to mention implement, and that Geocortex did not have
      the functionality that we needed. We decided to use one of the available ESRI web applications, as the CVCA had access to ArcGIS Online.</li>
    <li>Our original problem statement had a massive scope; we intended to allow the user to filter layers, search for data, and we intended to 
      include a ton of layers. Shawn said "no".</li>
  </ul>
  <p> <b>Next Steps:</b> Explore software options to find most accessible solution to our problem statement. </p> 

	  
  <h2>Week 10</h2>
  <h3>PHASE 2: Familiarizing Ourselves with Experience Builder and Developing Workflow</h3>
  	<p> <b>Action:</b> Although the concept remained the same, it was drastically reduced in scope. After looking through the web application options available such as Configurable Apps and ArcGIS Web App Builder, we decided that Experience Builder had all the functionality we need to successfully develop a solution. Our next step was to gather the required data, which we retrieved from our collaborative project client, upload it to ArcGIS Online and create a web map as well as an Experience Builder to host the web map. We spent time playing around with the available widgets and determining which ones could add the most value to our user experience. One of our biggest challenges was having all group member be able to access the web map and Experience Builder as the group sharing setting are finicky. </p> 
  	<p> <b>Outcomes:</b> The outcome of this was our Experience Builder shell with all our data hosted in a web map. To solve this sharing issues, we faced we had to change ownership of some feature layers and set sharing to public.  </p> 
  	<p> <b>Next Steps: </b> Once everyone could properly access the web map and Experience Builder, the next step was to customize the experience with our users in mind.   </p> 

  <h2>Week 11</h2>
  <h3>PHASE 3: Development within Experience Builder</h3>
  <p> <b>Action:</b> We began to customize our experience by working on the design esthetic. We added in the Conservation Authority logo, proper titles, and side bars to display map information. Making sure the layout was functional was imperative to the user "experience". We wanted to be sure that anybody accessing this solution would be able to easily navigate through the map. </p> 
  <p> <b>Outcomes:</b> These actions resulted in the first iteration of our Experience Builder. It had some user functionality with wetland data being displayed on the side bar when the user clicked around on the map feature layer as well as text communicating to the user the purpose of the application and how to use it.   </p> 
  <p> <b>Next Steps: </b> Now that we have communicated to the user how we want the interactive map to function we had to designed and implement that functionality. The next step was to research and develop arcade expression that could be used to customize pop-ups thereby displaying the exact information we want the user to know.  </p> 

  <h2>Week 12</h2>
  <h3>PHASE 4: Development within Experience Builder Continued</h3>
  <p> <b>Action:</b> Our focus know was developing the arcade expressions and configuring pop-ups to display the necessary information to the user. Ultimately, we wanted the user to know if their property intersected with any features that were regulated by the Conservation Authority. We did this by using the intersect functionality of arcade expression. Initially, we customize expressions for the parcel layer pop-ups to return a value of “Yes” if the parcel they clicked on intersected with the watershed boundary layer, waterbodies, watercourses, and wetland layers (provincially significant and otherwise). Knowing if a property intersected with these features will 1) Let the user know if their property was within Crow Valley’s jurisdiction and 2) whether their property had a feature that required a permit.  </p> 
  <p> <b>Outcomes:</b> Further development of the arcade expressions led to a solution that not only would return a value of “Yes” if the parcel intersected with another feature layer but also return a value of “No” if it did not. We also configured the pop-ups to display information about the wetland name and type. The benefit to using the Arcade expressions is that it allows the map to query those layers intersecting with the parcel of interest in real time, avoiding time-consuming pre-processing and making the application easy to adapt in the future.  </p> 
  <p> <b>Next Steps: </b> Although the basic functionality is in place, there are still issue with the Experience Builder. Mainly, that the display is not configured for all devices sizes and it has a cluttered appearance.  </p>

  <h2>Week 13</h2>
  <h3>PHASE 5: </h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>With the appliction now working there were still a few issues. It looked fantastic in some instances, 
      but there was text overlap and images clipping the bounds of the side bar, giving the page a cluttered appearance... </li>
    <li>Oh yeah, this thing is kinda due next week... We should probably start making a website for it! Lets 
      just grab a little css from here, a bit of html from there...</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 14</h2>
  <h3>PHASE 6: Hosting and Documenting our Solution</h3>
  <p> <b>Action:</b> Now that our experience builder was fully functional and provided the user with the information we wanted to communicate, we need to develop a website to host our solution. We were able to integrate the application pretty seamlessly using an Iframe. Please don’t be mad, Shawn! We tested this out on a mobile device, desktop, and Matt's mom's iPad.  </p> 
  <p> <b>Outcomes:</b> The final outcome of this project is a web site introducing our problem statement and project goals, the step-by-step development of the web solutions and a solution page hosting our Experience Builder.   </p> 
  <p> <b>Next Steps: </b> Hand into Shawn! </p>
