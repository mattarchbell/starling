  <h1>Our approach to finding a solution</h1>

  <h2>Week 9</h2>
  <p>Project idea development</p>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>We had the idea to develop a simple solution for Crowe Valley Conservation Authority to allow landowners to find wetland information 
    about their property using parcel data and wetland data and determining if those layers overlapped</li>
    <li>Although a simple idea, we struggled with how to implement this. Originally, we wanted to utilize open source solutions, namely Leaflet,
      as this would allow the solution to be adopted by anyone</li>
    <li>Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that Leaflet would take a lot of effort to learn, not to mention implement, and we were better off
      using some form of ESRI web application, as the CVCA had axcess to ArcGIS Online</li>
    <li>Our original problem statement had a massive scope; we intended to allow the user to filter layers, search for data, and we intended to 
      include a ton of layers. Shawn said "no"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 10</h2>
  <p>Project scope revamped</p>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>Our main idea remained the same, but with a drastically reduced scope. Our new plan of attack was to use ArcGIS Experience Builder to
      allow land owners to pick a parcel and have a pop-up display to show which layers intersected their land.
    </li>
    <li>With approval now garnered from Shawn, we began to explore the functionality of Experience Builder. First we needed data... and a way to 
      display it</li>
    <li>Our contact at CVCA was gracious enough to send over the parcel, wetlands, waterbodies, watercourses and CA boundary data, which we 
      uploaded to a webmap</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>Options we looked at</h2>
  <p>We originally intended to develop this application from scratch... Using open source- leaflet.
    we considered geocortex... Settled onto creating a web app using arcgis online resources, but which application would we use - Experience builder 
  </p>
  <h2>What worked</h2>
  <p>building widgets to costomize the design of our ArcGIS "experience" - worked mostly out of the gate - 
    struggled with clipping of images and title/text, extraneous info from map. 
    Most of the costomization had to be completed in webmaps -  arcade expressions to perform the functionality we wanted, making layers non-interactable, etc.</p>

  <h2>Arcade to the rescue</h2>
  <p>The main functionality of the program (querying the parcel data) comes from a simple arcade expression that checks to see if the layers we have (wetlands, 
    watercourses, waterbodies, etc. intersect/ are within the boundary of the parcel</p>
