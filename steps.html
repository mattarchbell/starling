  <h1>Our approuch to finding a solution</h1>

  <h2>Options we looked at</h2>
  <p>We originally intended to develop this application from scratch... Using open source- leaflet.
    we considered geocortex... Settled onto creating a web app using arcgis online resources, but which application would we use - Experience builder 
  </p>
  <h2>What worked</h2>
  <p>building widgets to costomize the design of our ArcGIS "experience" - worked mostly out of the gate - 
    struggled with clipping of images, extraneous info from map. 
    Most of the costomization had to be completed in webmaps -  arcade expressions to perform the functionality we wanted, making layers non-interactable, etc.</p>

  <h2>Arcade to the rescue</h2>
  <p>The main functionality of the program (querying the parcel data) comes from a simple arcade expression that checks to see if the layers we have (wetlands, 
    watercourses, waterbodies, etc. intersect/ are within the boundary of the parcel</p>
