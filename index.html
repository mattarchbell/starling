    <h1>Some important background information</h1>
    <p>Our collaborative project client, the Crowe Valley Conservation Authority, was looking for a way to allow landowners to determine if their 
      property was regulated by the Conservation Authority, instead of calling the office to waste their time! They get lots of calls from landowners 
      who often don't even need CA approval to build their new deck or to water their lawn. Let's take a closer look.</p>
  <h1>The problem</h1>
  <h2>In a perfect world</h2>
  <p>Landowners can determine if they need a permit from an online web map instead of needing to call the conservation authority</p>
  <h2>The reality</h2>
  <p>The Conservation Authority has data from multiple layers they use in the decision making process for land development. But the 
    land owners don't know that! There is currently no way for land owners to easily access this info. They must call the CA to discern whether
    features are present within their property or area that result in CA regulation.</p>
  <h2>The consequences of inaction</h2>
  <p>Landowners are unaware of what data is available in their area. They may not know if their property intersects lakes, rivers, provincially 
    signifacnt wetlands. This means they are unsure of whether a permit will be required to develop parts of their property.
    The Conservation Authority wastes time communicating with landowners who do not need permits</p>
  <h2>Our proposal</h2>
  <p>Landowners can access a website to find their property, then determine if it falls into Crowe Valley Conservation Authority regulation 
    based on which features exist on their property</p>
  <h2>Sounds easy right? ... Wrong!</h2>
