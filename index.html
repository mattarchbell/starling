  <h1>The Problem</h1>
  <h2>Ideal</h2>
  <p>Landowners can determine if they need a permit from an online web map instead of needing to call the conservation authority</p>
  <h2>Reality</h2>
  <p>Conservation authority has data from multiple layers they use in the decision making process for land development. Data layers are not continuous and land owners can not be sure if certain features are present within their property or area. Landowners are also unaware of which factors influence permit requirements. Conservation authority wastes time communicating with landowners who do not need permits</p>
  <h2>Consequences</h2>
  <p>Users are unaware of what data is available in their area. They may not know if their property intersects wetlands, rivers, etc. This means they are unsure of whether a permit will be required to develop parts of their property</p>
  <h2>Proposal</h2>
  <p>Landowners can access website to find their property and if it falls into Conservation Authority regulation based on which features exist on their property</p>
