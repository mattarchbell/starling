  <h1>The problem</h1>
  <h2>An ideal scenario</h2>
  <p>Landowners can determine if they need a permit from an online web map instead of needing to call the conservation authority</p>
  <h2>The reality</h2>
  <p>Conservation Authorities has data from multiple layers they use in the decision making process for land development. 
    Data layers are not continuous and land owners cannot easily access this info. They must call the CA to discern whether
    features are present within their property or area. Landowners are also unaware of the factors that influence permit requirements. </p>
  <h2>The consequences of not implementing our absolutely wonderful solution</h2>
  <p>Landowners are unaware of what data is available in their area. They may not know if their property intersects wetlands, rivers, etc. 
    This means they are unsure of whether a permit will be required to develop parts of their property.
    The Conservation Authority wastes time communicating with landowners who do not need permits</p>
  <h2>Our proposal</h2>
  <p>Landowners can access a website to find their property, then determine if it falls into Crowe Valley Conservation Authority regulation 
    based on which features exist on their property</p>
