    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>As part of Fleming College's Geographic Information Systems Application Specialist program, our <a href="about.html">Web GIS Development team</a> was tasked with exploring 
      and applying web technologies to address a problem with a Web GIS solution. Our goal was to emulate a municipal or consulting role, implementing a web solution based on a 
      real world need. To reach this goal, we developed a problem statement and proposed a solution to that problem, documented the steps we took to implement our proposed solution, 
      and lastly presented all facets of this project on this very website!
    </p>
    <h2>Problem:</h2>
    <p>Our collaborative project client, the Crowe Valley Conservation Authority, was looking for a way to allow landowners to determine if their 
      property is regulated by the Conservation Authority (CA), instead of calling into the office. They receive many calls from landowners 
      who often do not need CA approval to build on their property.</p>
    <p>The need for approval is predicated on the location of the property within the area regulated by the CA, and whether the property intersects 
      with sensitive watershed features, such as Provinically Significant Wetlands. The need here was twofold; the conservation authority wanted a 
      way to rapidly screen development proposals, and current and potential property owners would be well served by an application that can help them 
      identify project needs, such as coordination with the CA. 
      Let's take a closer look.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Resolution:</h2>
  <p>Landowners can determine if they need a permit from an online web map before or instead of contacting the Conservation Authority.</p>
  <h2>Reality of the Situation:</h2>
  <p>The Conservation Authority has data from multiple layers they use in the decision making process for land development. But land owners don't know that! 
    There is currently no way for land owners to easily access this info; they must call the Conservation Authority to discern whether
    features are present within their property that are under Conservation Authority regulation.</p>
  <h2>Consequences of Inaction:</h2>
  <p>Landowners are unaware of what data is available in their area. They may not know if their property intersects lakes, rivers or provincially 
    significant wetlands. This means they are unsure of whether a permit will be required to develop their property.
    The Conservation Authority wastes time communicating with land owners who do not need permits.</p>
  <h2>Project Proposal:</h2>
  <p>Land owners can access a website to find their property, then determine if it falls under Crowe Valley Conservation Authority regulation 
    based on which features exist on their property.</p>
  <h2>Sounds Easy, Right?</h2>
  <p>Wrong! Check out the <a href="steps.html"> steps</a> we took to to ensure the success of this project (and some of the struggles we faced along the way).</p>
