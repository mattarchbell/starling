    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>In Fleming College's GIS - Application Specialist program, our <a href="about.html">Web GIS Development team</a> was tasked with exploring and applying 
      web technologies to address a problem. The goal here was to emulate a municipal or consulting role and to implement a web solution based on a real world need.
      To reach this goal, we ultimately had to develop a problem statement and propose a solution, document the steps we took to implement our proposed solution, 
      and lastly present all facets of this project on this very website!
    </p>
    <h2>Problem:</h2>
    <p>Our collaborative project client, the Crowe Valley Conservation Authority, was looking for a way to allow landowners to determine if their 
      property was regulated by the Conservation Authority, instead of calling the office to waste their time! They get lots of calls from landowners 
      who often don't even need CA approval to build their new deck or to water their lawn. Let's take a closer look.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Resolution:</h2>
  <p>Landowners can determine if they need a permit from an online web map instead of needing to call the Conservation Authority.</p>
  <h2>Reality of the Situation:</h2>
  <p>The Conservation Authority has data from multiple layers they use in the decision making process for land development. But the 
    land owners don't know that! There is currently no way for land owners to easily access this info; they must call the Conservation Authority to discern whether
    features are present within their property that result in Conservation Authority regulation.</p>
  <h2>Consequences of Inaction:</h2>
  <p>Landowners are unaware of what data is available in their area. They may not know if their property intersects lakes, rivers, provincially 
    signiicant wetlands. This means they are unsure of whether a permit will be required to develop their property.
    The Conservation Authority wastes time communicating with land owners who do not need permits</p>
  <h2>Project Proposal:</h2>
  <p>Land owners can access a website to find their property, then determine if it falls into Crowe Valley Conservation Authority regulation 
    based on which features exist on their property</p>
  <h2>Sounds easy right?</h2>
  <p>Wrong! Check out the <a href="steps.html"> steps</a> we took to to ensure the success of this project (and some of the struggles we faced along the way).</p>
